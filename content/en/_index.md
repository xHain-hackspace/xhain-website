**Welcome to xHain: Hack- & Makespace in the heart of Friedrichshain, tinkering room for people interested in technology + space for net politics.**

## xHain locked down from Nov, 28th 2021 

Hey,

the official rules require a strict 2G+ protocol. Unfortunately we can't ensure to verify this reliably, so it's time to send xHain into lockdown again, effective immediately. No open Monday, meetups or events.

Hope to see you all soon! Stay safe!
Your xHain-team

## All creatures welcome
