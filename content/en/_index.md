## All creatures welcome

Whether you're a hacker, maker, or just curious, you're welcome at xHain! It doesn't matter how much experience you have, or if you're a student, retired, or anything in between, but whether you're interested in coding, electronics & soldering, woodworking, laser cutting, CNC milling, 3D printing, textiles, sewing, and more.

**We want everyone to feel comfortable at xHain!**

Our <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/en/xHain/xRoots" target="_blank">xRoots mentors</a> are here to help you get started, show you around at xHain, and answer your questions. If you have special needs or concerns, we will take care of them. Just look for people with the xRoots logo/badge on monday nights or talk to us in the <a href="https://chat.x-hain.de" target="_blank">chat</a>.

xHain is a smoke-free place. If you want to smoke, you can do so outside. If you are an asshole, e.g. sexist, racist, or homophobic, don't bother coming. Please read and follow our <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/en/xHain/spacerules" target="_blank">space rules</a>.
