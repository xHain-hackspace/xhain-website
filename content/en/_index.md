Our <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/en/about-xhain/xRoots">xRoots mentors</a> are here to help you get started, show you around at xHain, and answer your questions. If you have special needs or concerns, we will take care of them. Just look for people with the xRoots logo/badge on monday nights or talk to us in the <a href="https://chat.x-hain.de">chat</a>.

xHain is a smoke-free place. If you want to smoke, you can do so outside. If you are an asshole, e.g. sexist, racist, or homophobic, don't bother coming. Please read and follow our <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/de/HowTo_xhain/spacerules">space rules</a>.
