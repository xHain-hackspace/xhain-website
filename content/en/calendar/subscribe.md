Here's how to add the xHain event calendar to your favorite calendar app

### Using CalDAV

-   Open your calendar application and look for the option to add a new calendar. This might be under "Settings" or "Accounts."
-   Choose "CalDAV" as the account type if available.
-   In the server URL field, copy and paste this link: https://files.x-hain.de/remote.php/dav/public-calendars/Yi63cicwgDnjaBHR
-   Save the new calendar.
    Now you'll see all the upcoming xHain events directly in your calendar app!

This way, you won't miss out on workshops, talks, meetups, or any other events happening at xHain.

### Having trouble?

If you encounter any issues adding the calendar, check the documentation for your specific calendar app or reach out on our [Matrix chat]({{< param matrix >}}) for support.
