## Who we are

xHain is a non-profit organization that provides a space for anyone to build projects, learn new skills, and discuss important topics like digital politics. Over the years it has also become a hub for youth activities.

We have 200 members who support us. We organize workshops for adults on a wide variety of topics, including hacking and making. We partner with CoderDojo Germany e.V. and Jugend Hackt, where young people can learn programming and other skills.

xHain has an open culture encouraging cooperation and providing inspiration. We invite you to come and meet us every Monday evening, which is our Open Night. Come see our exhibit of art made of small bricks, circuit boards, and epoxy resin in our storefront street facing window. The huge tree made of LED strips is an iconic symbol for us, and is visible from the outside.

Amongst our diverse activities are "Gespräch unter Bäumen" - a series of women-led talks and discussions. Some of the many past highlights include our participation in large events, such as hosting stages for the Remote Chaos Experience during the pandemic, displaying our beautiful LED installations at live Chaos Computer Club events before the pandemic, and many contributions by individual xHain members at events large and small throughout Germany and the world. xHain is an important part of the Comenius neighborhood as an inclusive space for anyone who wants to discover and exchange ideas.
