xHain is an _open space_. No one has to be a member to come by and have fun. We are mainly financed by membership fees, one-time donations and rental income for events and office space.

## Become a member

Members are the heart of our space. Typically, members donate €13.37 or more per month and are most active in the use of equipment and tools, as well as the design of xHain. See our wiki for <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/en/xHain/members" target="_blank">more details about membership</a>.

You can <a href="https://login.x-hain.de/if/flow/xhain-member-enrollment/">register here</a> to become a member. You will receive a mail with all further details.
