## Calendar

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://files.x-hain.de/index.php/apps/calendar/embed/Yi63cicwgDnjaBHR/listMonth/now"></iframe>

Many of our events are open community events that are held at our place. You can also rent xHain as a meeting venue or space for (closed) events. If you're planning a workshop, looking for a more unconventional meeting space, want to screen your film or advance your fan fiction in a creative environment, ask us and we'll work out the details together.
