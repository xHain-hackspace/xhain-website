You are always welcome to drop by, but we don't have regular opening hours except for Monday evening. Many active members have a key themselves. If the space is just open or events are announced, every person is always welcome. Feel free to ask in the <a href="https://chat.x-hain.de" target="_blank">chat</a>, when someone is at xHain.
xHain sees itself as a do-ocracy and thrives from the commitment and ideas of the members. This means that members independently select and execute their projects.

## Become a member

Members are the heart of our space. Typically, members donate €13.37 or more per month and are most active in the use of equipment and tools, as well as the design of xHain. See our wiki for <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/de/HowTo_xhain/members" target="_blank">more details about membership</a>.

The work areas and their tools are marked in color. Some devices require a safety briefing by an authorized person. In our wiki you will find a more <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/en/Branches" target="_blank">detailed overview of our work areas and devices</a>.

## Events

Check out our <a href="/en/calendar">calendar</a> for upcoming events.

Many of our events are open community events that are held at our place. You can also rent xHain as a meeting venue or space for (closed) events. If you're planning a workshop, looking for a more unconventional meeting space, want to screen your film or advance your fan fiction in a creative environment, ask us and we'll work out the details together.
