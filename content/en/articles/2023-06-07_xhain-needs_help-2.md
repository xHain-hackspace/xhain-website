## What happened before
More information about our earlier call:\

## Meeting with the landlord
In late February we asked for your help to raise money to buy our space after we were approached by our landlord with their offer to sell it to us. We had to tell them by the end May if we wanted to accept their offer. On May 11th we met with the landlord and explained our plans about financing the purchase, and we agreed on a timeline of one year to come up with the money to buy the space. This is good news as our concern for coming up with all of the money in May was lifted.

## Felix's Retirement
In mid-April our founder Felix announced his retirement after 7 years as manager of xHain, saying that he would solely participate as a regular member.
This is why on June 16th management will be handed over to Björn, Dave, Sebastian, Niclas, and Richard.
We took this change as an opportunity to rethink our internal structures. We have been having regular meetings about forming a non-profit association ("Verein"), which will become the owner of the current structure. 

## What else do we do and what are our other options?
We've talked to Mietsyndikat and got valuable advice. 
We've made contact with very nice people with close ties to our space who are working on fundraising to buy the space.

We have also registered with the nonprofit project Haus der Statistik (a building complex near by Alexanderplatz) to possibly get a space there.
