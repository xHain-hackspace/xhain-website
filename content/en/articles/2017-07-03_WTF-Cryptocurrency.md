There will be a talk covering the following questions:

1. Was are the basics of modern cryptocurrencies? What is a Blockchain?
2. Bitcoin, Ethereum and Zcash.
   - What are the similarities?
   - Where are the differnces?
   - What are the core-concepts.?
3. Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake

As it's unlikely that all questions can be answered in a talk, there will be the opportunity to talk and discuss afterwards.
